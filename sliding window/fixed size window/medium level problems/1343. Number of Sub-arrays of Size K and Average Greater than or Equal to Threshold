Question

Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold. 

  

Example 1: 

Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4 
Output: 3 
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold). 
 

Example 2: 

Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5 
Output: 6 
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers. 

 

Solution: 

 

class Solution: 

    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int], k: int, threshold: int) -> int: 

        ag = 0 

        i=j=0 

        l = len(arr) 

        res =0 

        while(j<l): 

            ag += arr[j] 

            if j-i+1 < k: 

                j+=1 

            elif j-i+1 == k: 

                if ag/k >= threshold: 

                    res +=1 

                ag -= arr[i] 

                i +=1 

                j+=1 

        return res
